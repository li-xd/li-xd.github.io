一个请求之后 PHP如何来处理



```shell
## 还款 APP
curl -X "POST" "http://api.biz.docker/central/user-diversion" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -H 'Cookie: XDEBUG_SESSION=XDEBUG_ECLIPSE' \
     -d $'{
  "newSystemName": "李",
  "from_system": "BIZ",
  "key": "AM_0429558105487_TEST",
  "type": "UserDiversion",
  "applyCode": "202001095419253452669994"
}'

```



使用 tcpdump 监听 nginx 与 php-fpm 的交互内容



```shell
tcpdump tcp port 9000 -w 文件地址
```



使用 白鲨 解析后看到的结果

分析 三次握手 及 [三/四]次挥手过程

![markdown/20200601131135.png](https://note.img.lixd.club/markdown/20200601131135.png)

TCP 报头信息中有六个控制位(标志位)，分别是：SYN、ACK、PSH、FIN、RST 和 URG。

```
SYN: 表示建立连接
FIN: 表示关闭连接
ACK: 表示响应
PSH: 表示有数据传输
RST: 表示连接重置
URG: 表示紧急数据
```

三次握手过程: Flags 变化

1. 首先由 客户端向 服务端发送 Flags[SYN位]，Seq 为 x

![markdown/20200601131327.png](https://note.img.lixd.club/markdown/20200601131327.png)

![markdown/20200601131659.png](https://note.img.lixd.club/markdown/20200601131659.png)

通过软件处理后的 Seq 相对序列为 0, Flags 位标志为 SYN

发送完毕后，客户端进入 `SYN_SEND` 状态。

2. 由 服务器 发送给客户端 Flags[SYN位, ACK位]，Seq 为 y, ACK 为 x + 1

![markdown/20200601132708.png](https://note.img.lixd.club/markdown/20200601132708.png)

通过软件处理后其 Seq 为 0 [软件处理后相对序列] y，其 Ack = 1 为 x + 1, Flags 位标志为 SYN, ACK。

发送完毕后，服务器端进入 `SYN_RCVD` 状态。

3. 由 客户端 发送给服务器 Flags[ACK 位]，ACK 为 y + 1

![image-20200601132859292](/Users/lixiaodong/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200601132859292.png)

![markdown/20200601133002.png](https://note.img.lixd.club/markdown/20200601133002.png)

通过软件处理后其  Ack = 1 为 y + 1, Flags 位标志为 ACK。

发送完毕后，客户端进入 `ESTABLISHED` 状态，当服务器端接收到这个包时，也进入 `ESTABLISHED` 状态，TCP 握手结束。

关闭连接有两种方式，当一方关闭连接，另外一方没有数据发送时，马上关闭连接，也就将第二步的ack与第三步的fin合并为一步了，这个优化在RFC793 3.5节：

```
3.5.  Closing a Connection

  CLOSE is an operation meaning "I have no more data to send."  The
  notion of closing a full-duplex connection is subject to ambiguous
  interpretation, of course, since it may not be obvious how to treat
  the receiving side of the connection.  We have chosen to treat CLOSE
  in a simplex fashion.  The user who CLOSEs may continue to RECEIVE
  until he is told that the other side has CLOSED also.  Thus, a program
  could initiate several SENDs followed by a CLOSE, and then continue to
  RECEIVE until signaled that a RECEIVE failed because the other side
  has CLOSED.  We assume that the TCP will signal a user, even if no
  RECEIVEs are outstanding, that the other side has closed, so the user
  can terminate his side gracefully.  A TCP will reliably deliver all
  buffers SENT before the connection was CLOSED so a user who expects no
  data in return need only wait to hear the connection was CLOSED
  successfully to know that all his data was received at the destination
  TCP.  Users must keep reading connections they close for sending until
  the TCP says no more data.


                                                               [Page 37]

Transmission Control Protocol
Functional Specification



  There are essentially three cases:

    1) The user initiates by telling the TCP to CLOSE the connection

    2) The remote TCP initiates by sending a FIN control signal

    3) Both users CLOSE simultaneously

  Case 1:  Local user initiates the close

    In this case, a FIN segment can be constructed and placed on the
    outgoing segment queue.  No further SENDs from the user will be
    accepted by the TCP, and it enters the FIN-WAIT-1 state.  RECEIVEs
    are allowed in this state.  All segments preceding and including FIN
    will be retransmitted until acknowledged.  When the other TCP has
    both acknowledged the FIN and sent a FIN of its own, the first TCP
    can ACK this FIN.  Note that a TCP receiving a FIN will ACK but not
    send its own FIN until its user has CLOSED the connection also.

  Case 2:  TCP receives a FIN from the network

    If an unsolicited FIN arrives from the network, the receiving TCP
    can ACK it and tell the user that the connection is closing.  The
    user will respond with a CLOSE, upon which the TCP can send a FIN to
    the other TCP after sending any remaining data.  The TCP then waits
    until its own FIN is acknowledged whereupon it deletes the
    connection.  If an ACK is not forthcoming, after the user timeout
    the connection is aborted and the user is told.

  Case 3:  both users close simultaneously

    A simultaneous CLOSE by users at both ends of a connection causes
    FIN segments to be exchanged.  When all segments preceding the FINs
    have been processed and acknowledged, each TCP can ACK the FIN it
    has received.  Both will, upon receiving these ACKs, delete the
    connection.
